# Overview

The software I wrote to demonstrate the Java language is a console banking application. It has all the standard
operations of an ATM machine such as, deposit, withdraw, check balance, and view previous transaction of funds. A user can interact with 
the software through the console. 

As a software engineer the purpose for writing this software was to implement variables, expressions,
conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and data structures into a working program. This software demonstrates how to
use the latter to create a software program in Java. This software was written to further increase programming knowledge 
in a new language.  I plan to use this program as a first iteration to build upon by implementing advanced features.
